# The Maze Game 

Welcome to the whimsical world of the **Multi-Level Maze Game**! Ever feel like your life is just one big maze? Well, here’s your chance to navigate a series of increasingly wacky labyrinths as a brave little green square. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and it’s guaranteed to make you question your sense of direction (in the best way possible).
